## Philosophy

MLTrack is built on three core principles:

### 1. **Zero Friction Enhancement**
We don't replace MLflow - we enhance it. Your existing MLflow projects, models, and workflows continue to work exactly as before. MLTrack simply adds what's missing.

### 2. **Developer Experience First**
Every command, every UI element, every workflow is designed to spark joy. We believe ML deployment should be as simple as `ml ship model`.

### 3. **Production Ready**
From cost tracking to multi-cloud deployment, MLTrack includes everything you need to run ML in production, not just experiments.
