# Deployment

MLTrack's killer feature is one-command deployment. Deploy your models to production without writing Dockerfiles, Kubernetes configs, or API code.

## The Deployment Problem

Traditional ML deployment is painful:
- Package dependencies correctly
- Write a Dockerfile
- Create API endpoints
- Handle authentication
- Set up monitoring
- Configure auto-scaling
- Manage costs

**MLTrack handles all of this with one command.**

## One-Command Deployment

Deploy any MLflow model instantly:

```bash
# Deploy to Modal (serverless)
ml ship model --modal

# Deploy to AWS Lambda
ml ship model --aws-lambda

# Deploy as Docker container
ml ship model --docker
```

That's it. Your model is live with a production-ready API.

## How It Works

MLTrack follows these steps:

**Step One**: Model Detection - MLTrack identifies your model from the MLflow registry and analyzes its requirements

**Step Two**: Dependency Resolution - Automatically captures all dependencies including system libraries and Python packages

**Step Three**: Container Building - Creates an optimized container with your model and all dependencies

**Step Four**: API Generation - Generates production-ready REST endpoints with proper error handling

**Step Five**: Deployment - Pushes to your chosen platform and returns the endpoint URL

## Deployment Targets

### Modal (Recommended)
