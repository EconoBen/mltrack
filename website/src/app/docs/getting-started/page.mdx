# Introduction to MLTrack

MLTrack is a powerful enhancement for MLflow that adds deployment capabilities, cost tracking, and a modern UI while maintaining 100% compatibility with your existing MLflow code.

## Why MLTrack?

If you're already using MLflow, you know it's great for experiment tracking. But when it comes to deployment and team collaboration, you might find yourself:

- Writing custom deployment scripts
- Building your own UI
- Manually tracking costs
- Struggling with multi-user access

MLTrack solves these problems by providing:

### 🚀 One-Command Deployment
```bash
ml ship model --modal
```
Deploy your models to production with a single command. No Dockerfiles, no complex configurations.

### 💻 Modern, Beautiful UI
- Real-time experiment tracking
- Cost analytics dashboards
- Model comparison tools
- Team collaboration features

### 💰 Built-in Cost Tracking
- Automatic LLM token tracking
- Compute cost monitoring
- Budget alerts
- Cost optimization insights

### 👥 Team-First Design
- User-specific API keys
- Experiment filtering by user
- Shared team experiments
- Access control

## How It Works

MLTrack acts as a layer on top of MLflow:

```python
# Your existing MLflow code continues to work
import mlflow
mlflow.start_run()
mlflow.log_metric("accuracy", 0.95)

# Add MLTrack for superpowers
from mltrack import ship
ship("my-model", platform="modal")
```

## Key Concepts

Before diving in, it's helpful to understand these key concepts:

- **Experiments** - Groups of related model runs
- **Runs** - Individual model training sessions
- **Metrics** - Quantitative measurements (accuracy, loss, etc.)
- **Parameters** - Model configuration (learning rate, batch size, etc.)
- **Artifacts** - Files produced by runs (models, plots, etc.)
- **Deployments** - Production-ready model endpoints
