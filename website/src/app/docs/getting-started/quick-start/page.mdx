# Quick Start

Get up and running with MLTrack in 5 minutes. This guide will walk you through installation, tracking your first experiment, and deploying a model.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip or uv package manager

## Step 1: Install MLTrack

<Tabs items={['pip', 'uv']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
```bash
pip install ml-track
```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
```bash
uv add ml-track
```
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

## Step 2: Initialize Your Project

Create a new directory for your project and initialize MLTrack:

```bash
mkdir my-ml-project
cd my-ml-project
ml init
```

This creates a `.mltrack.yml` configuration file with sensible defaults.

## Step 3: Track Your First Experiment

Create a file called `train.py`:

```python
from mltrack import track
import numpy as np
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

@track
def train_model(n_estimators=100, max_depth=10):
    # Generate sample data
    X, y = make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_features=20, random_state=42)
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)
    
    # Train model
    model = RandomForestClassifier(
        n_estimators=n_estimators,
        max_depth=max_depth,
        random_state=42
    )
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    
    # Log metrics
    accuracy = model.score(X_test, y_test)
    return model, accuracy

# Run training
model, accuracy = train_model()
print(f"Model accuracy: {accuracy:.3f}")
```

Run the training script:

```bash
ml train train.py
```

<Callout type="info">
  MLTrack automatically detects your ML framework and logs relevant metrics!
</Callout>

## Step 4: View Results in the UI

Launch the MLTrack UI to see your experiments:

```bash
ml ui
```

Open your browser to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see:
- Your experiment run
- Logged parameters and metrics
- Model artifacts
- Real-time updates

## Step 5: Save Your Model

Save your trained model to the MLTrack registry:

```bash
ml save my-classifier --run-id <run-id-from-ui>
```

## Step 6: Deploy Your Model

Deploy your model to Modal with a single command:

```bash
ml ship my-classifier --modal
```

<Callout type="success">
  🎉 Congratulations! Your model is now deployed and accessible via API.
</Callout>

The deployment provides:
- REST API endpoint
- Automatic scaling
- Request/response logging
- Cost tracking

## Step 7: Test Your Deployment

Test your deployed model:

```bash
ml try my-classifier --data '[[1.0, 2.0, ..., 20.0]]'
```

## What's Next?

Now that you have MLTrack running:

- Learn about [MLflow Integration](/docs/getting-started/mlflow-integration)
- Explore the [CLI Commands](/docs/guides/cli)
- Set up [Team Collaboration](/docs/guides/teams)
- Configure [LLM Tracking](/docs/guides/llm-tracking)

## Quick Reference

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `ml init` | Initialize MLTrack project |
| `ml train <script>` | Run training script with tracking |
| `ml ui` | Launch the dashboard |
| `ml save <name>` | Save model to registry |
| `ml ship <name>` | Deploy model |
| `ml try <name>` | Test deployment |

## Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary>MLTrack command not found</summary>

Make sure you've installed MLTrack with pip:
```bash
pip install ml-track
```

If using a virtual environment, ensure it's activated.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Port 3000 already in use</summary>

The UI runs on port 3000 by default. Use a different port:
```bash
ml ui --port 8080
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Modal deployment requires authentication</summary>

Set up your Modal token:
```bash
pip install modal
modal token new
```
