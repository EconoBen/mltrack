## üìä Analytics Integration
All analytics components are integrated into the main analytics page with responsive tab layout:
- Overview, Time Series, Real-time, Cost, Tokens, Performance, Models, Users, Reports

## üé® UI/UX Improvements
- Empty states with clear CTAs
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Smooth animations with Framer Motion
- Consistent icon usage and color coding
- Professional data visualization with Recharts
- Keyboard shortcuts for power users

## üîß Technical Additions
- Created missing UI components: `RadioGroup`, `use-toast`
- Added Zod for schema validation (needs npm install)
- Implemented debounce hook for search performance
- Cross-tab synchronization for preferences
- Local storage persistence patterns

## üìù Configuration Updates
- Updated navigation with search integration
- Added preferences link to user menu
- Responsive tab layouts for analytics
- Theme and animation preferences applied globally

## üöÄ Next Steps (Remaining TODOs)
1. Create data lineage tracking system
2. Build UI components for data browsing and lineage visualization
3. Create migration tools from old storage to new
4. Implement manifest caching for performance
5. Add team management features
6. Add collaboration features (comments, sharing)
7. Update decorators to add experiment type tags
8. Create Modal.com deployment integration
9. Add support for additional storage backends (GCS, Azure)

## üí° Key Decisions Made
- Used Charm.sh principles for terminal UIs
- Implemented "No Live Models" state for production dashboard
- Chose local storage for preferences (vs. backend API)
- Used sheet component for filters (vs. dropdown)
- Implemented fuzzy search algorithm for better UX

## üêõ Known Issues
- Zod needs to be installed (`npm install zod`)
- PDF/Excel export not yet implemented (placeholders)
- Some chart predictions are simulated data
- Real-time data needs WebSocket connection for production

## üì¶ Dependencies Added
- `zod` - Schema validation for preferences
- `@radix-ui/react-radio-group` - Radio group component
- Already had: Recharts, date-fns, Framer Motion

This checkpoint represents significant progress in making MLTrack a comprehensive, user-friendly ML experiment tracking platform with professional analytics and search capabilities.
