# Enhanced Analytics & Insights Design for MLtrack

## Overview
Based on analysis of leading LLM observability tools (Portkey.ai, Langfuse, Helicone), we'll enhance MLtrack with beautiful, insightful analytics dashboards.

## Design Principles
1. **Real-time insights** - Live updating charts and metrics
2. **Beautiful aesthetics** - Modern, clean design with smooth animations
3. **Actionable data** - Focus on metrics that drive decisions
4. **Performance focus** - Optimize for cost, latency, and quality

## Core Analytics Components

### 1. Executive Dashboard
**Purpose**: High-level overview for quick insights

**Key Metrics Cards**:
- Total Experiments & Runs (with trend)
- Total Cost (with daily/weekly/monthly breakdown)
- Average Latency (with performance indicator)
- Success Rate (with comparison to baseline)
- Active Users (with growth percentage)
- Token Usage (with cost implications)

**Charts**:
- Cost trend line chart (30-day rolling)
- Model usage distribution (donut chart)
- Latency histogram with percentiles
- Success/failure rate over time

### 2. Cost Analytics Dashboard
**Purpose**: Deep dive into spending patterns

**Features**:
- Cost by model provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- Cost by experiment/project
- Cost by user/team
- Token efficiency metrics
- Cost anomaly detection
- Budget tracking and alerts

**Visualizations**:
- Stacked area chart for cost over time
- Heatmap for hourly/daily usage patterns
- Sankey diagram for cost flow
- Budget gauge charts

### 3. Performance Analytics
**Purpose**: Optimize latency and throughput

**Metrics**:
- P50, P90, P99 latencies
- Time to first token (for streaming)
- Request duration distribution
- Error rates by endpoint
- Cache hit rates

**Charts**:
- Latency percentile lines
- Response time distribution (violin plot)
- Error rate timeline with annotations
- Performance comparison matrix

### 4. Model Comparison Dashboard
**Purpose**: Compare models side-by-side

**Features**:
- Cost per 1K tokens comparison
- Quality metrics comparison
- Latency comparison
- Feature support matrix
- A/B test results

**Visualizations**:
- Radar charts for multi-metric comparison
- Scatter plots (cost vs quality)
- Bar charts for head-to-head metrics
- Decision matrix heatmap

### 5. User Activity Analytics
**Purpose**: Understand usage patterns

**Metrics**:
- Active users over time
- Requests per user
- Popular experiments
- User journey funnel
- Team collaboration metrics

**Charts**:
- User activity heatmap (calendar view)
- Top users leaderboard
- Experiment popularity bubble chart
- Collaboration network graph

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Stack
- **Charting Library**: Recharts or Tremor (React-based, beautiful defaults)
- **Animation**: Framer Motion for smooth transitions
- **Real-time Updates**: React Query with WebSocket support
- **Date Handling**: date-fns for time series
- **Export**: jsPDF for report generation

### Data Architecture
```typescript
// Analytics data structure
interface AnalyticsData {
  metrics: {
    cost: TimeSeriesData;
    latency: LatencyDistribution;
    tokens: TokenUsage;
    errors: ErrorMetrics;
  };
  comparisons: {
    models: ModelComparison[];
    experiments: ExperimentComparison[];
  };
  insights: {
    anomalies: Anomaly[];
    recommendations: Recommendation[];
  };
}
```

### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/analytics/overview` - Executive dashboard data
- `GET /api/analytics/cost` - Cost analytics
- `GET /api/analytics/performance` - Performance metrics
- `GET /api/analytics/models/compare` - Model comparison
- `GET /api/analytics/users` - User activity
- `WebSocket /api/analytics/live` - Real-time updates

## UI/UX Design Guidelines

### Color Palette
```css
--primary: #6366f1;      /* Indigo */
--success: #10b981;      /* Emerald */
--warning: #f59e0b;      /* Amber */
--danger: #ef4444;       /* Red */
--neutral: #6b7280;      /* Gray */
--background: #ffffff;   /* White */
--surface: #f9fafb;      /* Light gray */
```

### Chart Design
- Consistent color scheme across all charts
- Smooth animations on data updates
- Interactive tooltips with detailed info
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Dark mode support

### Layout Principles
- Card-based layout for modularity
- Collapsible sections for information hierarchy
- Filter bar at top for global controls
- Export buttons on each chart
- Full-screen mode for detailed analysis
