# MLTrack Project Status & mltrack.xyz Website Plan

## üìä Current Project Status

### What We've Built
MLTrack is a powerful drop-in enhancement for MLflow that adds deployment capabilities and a modern UI. Here's what we've accomplished:

#### Core Features ‚úÖ
1. **Enhanced CLI** (`ml` or `mltrack`)
   - Simple commands: `ml train`, `ml save`, `ml ship`, `ml try`
   - Modal deployment integration
   - Works alongside existing MLflow

2. **Modern React/Next.js UI**
   - Beautiful dashboard with real-time updates
   - Experiment tracking with advanced analytics
   - Model registry and deployment management
   - Cost tracking for ML and LLM experiments

3. **Authentication System**
   - Flexible auth with development/production modes
   - Welcome page for first-time users
   - GitHub OAuth and email magic links support
   - Graceful handling of missing configuration

4. **Developer Experience**
   - Zero-config start with mock data
   - Clear setup instructions
   - Smart defaults for everything
