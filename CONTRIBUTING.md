## Style Guidelines

### Python Code Style

* Use Black for formatting
* Use ruff for linting
* Add type hints where possible
* Write docstrings for all public functions

### TypeScript/React Code Style

* Use TypeScript for all new components
* Follow the existing component structure
* Use functional components with hooks
* Add proper types for all props and state
* Use Tailwind CSS for styling

### Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

Example:
```
